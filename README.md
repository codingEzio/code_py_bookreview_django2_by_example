### Introduction
- Looking back my learning path, I would say it's quite dumb.
    - *always following the book*
    - *frustated when something doesn't work as expected*
    - *hoping to become a GREAT dev by just reading a few books*

### *No* !


### So...
- For this book, the whole process will be meant to review the concepts & some best practices.
- Not just focusing on the *result*, the dead, the copy-paste-and-works-as-expected result.
